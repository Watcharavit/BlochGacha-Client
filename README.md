# BlockGacha

This is the frontend part of our Blockchain Project. It is a final project for Chulalongkorn University's 2110595 ADV TOP COMP V (Blockchain Technology)

You can find the backend part here (https://github.com/Watcharavit/BlockGacha)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First run `npm install` to install dependencies
Then, setup the environments. You can lookup the example at `.env.example`

`NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` should be where you deploy your backend, such as `http://localhost:5000`
`NEXTAUTH_URL` should be the url of frontend, such as `http://localhost:3000`

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
